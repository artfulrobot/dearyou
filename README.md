# Dear You

This extension provides a couple of tokens that you may want to use in your
emails, for example.

For example: you might want it to say "Dear Billy," (using nickname), but if
there's no nickname, "Dear William," (using first name) and if there's no first
name, simply "Hi,".

There are settings for individuals, organisations and households, and a set of
these for 'informal' and one for 'formal'.
